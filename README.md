# WorkTimeCLI

A Python-based CLI that helps you keep track of your time you spend on various tasks.
Your tasks, it start and ending times are conviniently stored in a CSV file allowing you to easily
analyze your time tracking data and have full control over your data at all times.

The CLI also calculates summaries of tasks stored in the file "tasks.csv". After the summary is created,
the "tasks.csv" is deleted and all tasks are moved to the "historical_tasks.csv" file.

With WorkTimeCLI, you can take control of your work day and optimize your time.

## Disclaimer
This project is a work in progress. As the developer, I was not satisfied with the existing solutions to track task times, 
so I created this CLI to help myself and others better manage their productivity. 
However, please note that there may still be uncaught bugs or issues that need to be addressed. 
Use this tool at your own risk and always keep backups of your data. 
Feedback and contributions to improve this project are welcome and appreciated. Thank you for your understanding.
